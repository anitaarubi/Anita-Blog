         THE EVOLUTION OF DIGITAL INTERACTION
The evolution of digital interaction has seen a progression from simple text-based communication to dynamic multimedia engagement. It has transformed how people connect, share information, and collaborate online. Early forms of digital interaction were primarily text-centric, involving email, chat rooms, and forums. As technology advanced, the internet became more accessible, leading to the rise of social media platforms, where users could share not only text but also images, videos, and other multimedia content.

The advent of smartphones further revolutionized digital interaction by making it more mobile and instantaneous. Mobile apps, messaging platforms, and social media apps became integral parts of daily life, enabling people to stay connected on the go. The emergence of live streaming, virtual reality, and augmented reality has added new dimensions to digital interaction, allowing for more immersive and real-time experiences.

The evolution continues with the integration of artificial intelligence, voice commands, and other emerging technologies, promising even more personalized and seamless digital interactions. Overall, the journey from text-based communication to today's multifaceted, interactive digital landscape reflects the ongoing innovation and adaptability of technology in meeting human communication needs.

2003 was a new era for social media where MySpace became a popular place to be. MySpace was an inspiration for todays platforms like Facebook. LinkedIn was also among the early ones using this time aimed for professionals.

2004 Mark Zuckerberg launched the Facebook which ultimately became a social media giant, was initially made for Havard students. In 2006 text messaging and SMS inspired the creation of Twitter which can be uniquely identified by its 140 character limit.

2007 onwards the rest of the innovative social media platforms came into existence. Among the earliest was Flickr which was most popular photo sharing. Others that were introduced were Photobucket and Instagram, with Instagram gaining more popularity today. Tumblr was introduced as a microblogging website now owned by Yahoo. Other social media platforms that got introduced where Foursquare, Pinterest, Spotify, Google Buzz, Loopt, Blippy and Groupon.

Around 2010 Social Media evolved from being widely used for personal use to being used in business. Websites started displaying links to their social media address. Companies started displaying their social media profiles in TV commercials. Social Media icons spread like wild fire.

Over the course of the past three years, “Fourth screen” technologies like smartphones, tablets, etc. have changed social networking and the way we communicate with one another entirely.

Businesses could easily connect the dots and it was suddenly very conspicuous that social media is where they must be. This is where everyone is. This is where their target audience is.
